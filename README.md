# OBS DECK

Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt in terminal CLI.

Even before I knew how to code something, I had that dream idea to put an OBS deck (which I do not have) into the computer to randomly draw a card and also add my own cards to the deck. A couple of days ago, I remembered that I wanted to make that project, and now here it isâ€”_it's alive!_

## Installation

You'll need Ruby, of course, Bundler, and knowledge of how to run programs from the terminal (Google if you have not; it'll take no more than 15 minutes).

Download the code as a zip file.
Go to the downloaded directory from the terminal:

```
$ cd obs-deck
```

Run inside the terminal:

```
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Run inside the terminal:

```
$ ruby app/main.rb
```

Then it should be pretty straightforward.

## Credit

I've used all the strategies from [ptigas/oblique-strategies](https://github.com/ptigas/oblique-strategies/). Then I cleaned them up by script and by hand.

If you want a more accessible way to use Oblique Strategies from anywhere in your terminal, then you'll be better off installing this gem: [nodanaonlyzuul/oblique_strategies](https://github.com/nodanaonlyzuul/oblique_strategies)
